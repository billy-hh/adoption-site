description: We love to host our friends and family at our house! Each year, our get-togethers become bigger and more lively. The last few years, one of our new traditions is hosting a small New Year's Eve party, complete with serving and shucking oysters. We also cherish hosting major holidays like Easter, Christmas, and Thanksgiving, creating warm and festive gatherings for our loved ones. <p> The highlight of our year is our annual Oktoberfest, which has grown into our biggest and most anticipated event. We go all out to create a fun and memorable celebration, bringing everyone together in a joyful atmosphere. We make our own homemade potato pancakes, sometimes if we are lucky in the garden, we can use our own homegrown potatoes. <p> We cannot wait to include our kids in these parties, celebrating all of their milestones with our friends and family, and making these moments even more special.
