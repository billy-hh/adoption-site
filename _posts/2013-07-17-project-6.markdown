description: Hi, I'm Sarah, and I'm 35 years old. I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA. I graduated from Penn State's main campus and now work as a Software Engineer, writing code for a regional bank. It is a job that I find both challenging and rewarding. <p> When I'm not busy working, I love to connect with my family. Cooking and gardening are two of my favorite hobbies, providing a creative outlet and a sense of tranquility. I also enjoy unwinding by watching reality TV and getting lost in a good book. <p> Family has always been a central part of my life. I have three wonderful siblings (each with families of their own) and grew up surrounded by a huge, loving family. My mom was the youngest of eight siblings, and my dad was the youngest of seven, making family gatherings lively and full of joy. With our Greek and Italian heritage, family is always around, and these relationships are incredibly important to me. <p> I am beyond excited to become a mom. I cannot wait to share my unconditional love with a child (children, if we are lucky) and to teach them how to be a great person, a kind friend, and a fantastic chef. <p>  I'm looking forward to all the wonderful moments that come with being a mom, from watching them play soccer in the backyard, riding bikes out front, reading nightly bedtime stories, to sitting around the kitchen table, just talking about all the exciting parts of their day. Becoming a mom is a dream I hold close to my heart, and I can't wait to embrace every moment of it. Billy and I have already been working hard to creating a warm, nurturing home that is ready for kids, and we cannot wait for the day when our dreams become a reality.
