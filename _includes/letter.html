                Dear Birth Family, <p>

                Thank you for considering us as potential parents for your child. We feel deeply honored that you’re taking the time to get to know us.
                As we prepare to welcome a child into our lives through adoption, our hearts are overflowing with excitement and love.
                We've been blessed in so many ways, and our greatest hope is to share those blessings with your baby, providing them with a life filled with warmth, security, and endless joy.<p>

                We met shortly after college and, right from the start, knew that our shared values—family, love, and a good sense of humor—would shape the life we wanted to build together.
                Over the years, we’ve stayed true to those values, creating a warm, supportive, and fun home where love is always at the center.<p>

                Both of us work in technology, and we have a passion for creating—whether it’s developing software solutions or building projects by hand.
                We enjoy working together on projects around the house, from renovating spaces and crafting furniture to tending to our garden.
                Our home reflects this love of creativity and collaboration, and we are excited to share this environment with a child.<p>

                Family has always been central to our lives. After dating for less than a year, our families went on a joint vacation to Hilton Head Island—something that speaks to how quickly and deeply we value those connections.
                We love to bring everyone together, celebrating both the big milestones and the little moments. Our gatherings are always filled with laughter, joy, and a lot of delicious food!
                Your child would be welcomed into this big, loving family, surrounded by cousins to grow up alongside.
                There are already so many people thinking about you and your baby, sending love and prayers your way.<p>

                We’ve created a nurturing environment with a big backyard perfect for playtime, a cozy playroom ready for story time and movie nights, and a big kitchen for creating delicious meals and tasty treats each and every day.
                We can’t wait to fill these spaces with the sounds of a child’s laughter and the joy of new memories.<p>

                We are so excited to begin new family traditions that will be uniquely ours while continuing on some of our existing traditions.
                Growing up, Sarah’s family had sweet traditions like picnic blanket dinners in the living room while watching favorite movies and baking homemade cookies after every first day of school.
                These are traditions we’re excited to carry on with our family, but we also can’t wait to see what new special moments we create together.<p>

                As we embark on this journey, we want you to know that we understand the significance of the decision you’re making.
                If you choose us, we promise to provide a loving, stable, and nurturing home where your child will always feel supported and cherished.
                We will celebrate every part of their life, honor their story, and ensure they know how deeply they are loved by us—and by you.<p>

                Thank you again for considering us. We would love the opportunity to get to know you better and to share more about the life we hope to build with your child.<p>

                With heartfelt thanks,<p>

                Billy & Sarah
